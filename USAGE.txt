Currently, this package relies on a couple of patches for the Zend\Code library
that have not yet been accepted upstream:
https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/59
https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/61

As there is no clear roadmap for when these patches will be accepted, you will
need to use apply the patches manually after installing your dependencies with
composer.

For the sake of convenience, these patches are contained within the file
'zendcode_fixes.patch' within this repository. You can apply the patch file
with the GNU patch utility by navigating to the top-level directory for the
Zend\Code package and running the following command:

patch -p1 < /path/to/zendcode_fixes.patch
