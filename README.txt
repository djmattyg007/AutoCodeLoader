AutoCodeLoader

This project will automatically generate Factories, Proxies and Setter Traits
to avoid you having to duplicate this boilerplate constantly.

Currently its scope is somewhat limited. It will not yet generate proxies, and
it will only generate Factories designed to work with the Aura.Di dependency
injection container.

This software is released into the public domain without any warranty.
