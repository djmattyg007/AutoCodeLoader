AutoCodeLoader

This project will automatically generate Factories, Proxies and Setter Traits
to avoid you having to duplicate this boilerplate constantly.

Currently its scope is somewhat limited. It will not yet generate proxies, and
it will only generate Factories designed to work with the Aura.Di dependency
injection container. Feel free to contribute patches to add support for other
systems though!

I built this because I was unable to find something simple that wasn't weighed
down by many dependencies, and that had first-class support for PHP7.
